# Cafe Full-Stack Test App

In this exercise, we are going to build a small web app for creating a cafe menu.

Please use git, and structure the commits like you would in a real team project. Send your results as a zip of the project folder or a link to a public GitHub repo.

Please include a README file which explains how to setup and run the application, or even deploy the app to Heroku if you like.

Please follow the style of the designs supplied.

# Tech

- Use a recent version of Rails plus any libraries you like.
- You can choose any choice of framework for the front-end.

# Features

- Implement the basic 'menu list' and 'add menu item' form.
- When a menu item is created, save it to the database.
- When the browser is reloaded, load the menu list from the database.
- Implement Edit and Delete buttons and functionality.
- Implement the photo upload in the 'add menu item' form.
- Menu item images should be uploaded somewhere. It's up to you to find and choose a file store or image uploading service.

# Tests

- Please write tests for the 'add menu item' feature. You can choose to write unit, integration or both and use the testing libraries of your choice.

If you have any questions please let us know.
